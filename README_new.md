# Graph Algorithms in C++
# ID - 318727187
## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a graph structure and several classical graph algorithms in C++, without using STL containers (as required by the assignment).
The project includes unit tests using the `doctest` framework, and supports memory leak checks using `valgrind`.

## 🧱 Classes and Their Roles

### `Graph`
- Uses adjacency list (`Neighbor*`) for storing undirected or directed weighted edges(using Struct)
- Supports adding/removing edges and querying neighbors.

### `Algorithms` (Static)
Implements the following algorithms:
- `bfs(Graph, source)`
- `dfs(Graph, source)`
- `dijkstra(Graph, source)`
- `prim(Graph)`
- `kruskal(Graph)`

Each algorithm throws `std::invalid_argument` when given an invalid input (e.g., invalid source vertex, negative weights, or empty graph).

### `Queue`
- Implements a basic queue using a linked list.
- Used by BFS algorithm.

### `PriorityQueue`
- Min-priority queue for integers (vertices).
- Used in Dijkstra and Prim algorithms.

### `EdgePriorityQueue`
- Min-priority queue for edges based on weights.
- Used in Kruskal’s algorithm.

### `UnionFind`
- Disjoint-set structure with path compression and union by rank.
- Detects cycles in Kruskal’s algorithm.

## 🧪 Unit Testing

Tests are located in `test.cpp` using [doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest).

### To run the tests:
```
make test  
./graph_test
```

Tests include:
- Basic graph operations
- Validity and correctness of each algorithm
- Edge cases such as empty graphs, disconnected graphs, and isolated vertices
- Exception handling for invalid inputs

## 🧼 Memory Leak Detection

Memory is manually managed (new/delete). Use `valgrind` to check for leaks.

### To check for memory leaks:
```
make valgrind
```

Valgrind will run both the test executable and the demo (`graph_demo`) and print a memory usage summary.

---

## 🚀 Running the Demo

The demo file `Main.cpp` shows usage of all algorithms on various example graphs.

### To build and run:
```
make Main  
./graph_demo
```

---

## 🧹 Clean Build Files

To remove all compiled output files and object files:
```
make clean
```

---

## 📌 Notes

- STL containers were avoided intentionally, using custom data structures only.
- Algorithms are designed with robustness in mind.
- Valgrind results confirm no memory leaks.
- Proper exception handling is in place for all critical input checks.
